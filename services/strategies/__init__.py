# services/strategies/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'strategies' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally import strategy generation functions here to make them
# available directly from the package, e.g.:
# from .gap_guardian import generate_signals as generate_gap_guardian_signals
# from .unicorn import generate_signals as generate_unicorn_signals
# from .silver_bullet import generate_signals as generate_silver_bullet_signals

# However, for the current refactoring, strategy_engine.py will handle specific imports.
